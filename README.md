# BookStore
It is a python-server web based application for book inventory management. It maintains a record of the number of copies of every book in the inventory.
The Google Book API is used to get the details of a book and the user wants to add that particular book to the inventory then the user can also do that.
The user can see the list of all the books in the inventory and can search for a particular book as well. The search operation uses the Google Books API.
After searching the user can add the book to his inventory and also update existing books in the inventory or remove a book in the inventory.
When the user first opens the platform he sees the inventory and the books which are in stock and which are out of stock and then search for a book and add it to the inventory.

The technology stack used is Python and Django for the backend and MaterialiseCSS, HTML, JavaScript and CSS for the backend.
